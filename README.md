This folder includes files used for 3D printing the 6-inch enclosure designed by AscensionWx.

Note that the folder "stl" includes the basic 3D CAD files. These can be viewed online or modified with commercial webapps and software. For example, TinkerCAD or Fusion360

The "gx" folder includes files for direct 3D printing. Please only use the gx files for your corresponding printer. If you have a different 3D printer, please download the files in the "stl" folder and import into a Slicer software suitable for your printer. If the prints turn out successfully, feel free to create a pull request to upload your own Sliced files to the "gx" folder.
